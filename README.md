This is a project started by Muhammad Ikhsan as platform to learn and improve his skill on test automation using a demo website automationpractice.com, an E-Commerce demo website.

What he want to achieve:
1. To gradually improve as QA tester, mainly in automation. It will be nice to see my improvement code-by-code
2. To Create an easy-to-understand code for those who also learning automation
3. To serve as portofolio for future jobs (?)

What are the tools i used?
1. Cypress (js) for the automation
2. VS Code as the IDE for writing the code
3. Google sheets, to create the documentation

The priority of this project should looks like this:
1. Create test cases (manually) to understand what to do and what can be achieved. I separate test cases per pages (i called it section).
2. Following up on the test cases by creating the automation (Cypress)
3. Once a section is completed, i'll try to setup CI/CD, though it will take some time as i need to learn more about this

As for the GSheets itself, please refer to link below to see my progress, test cases, and other stuff.
